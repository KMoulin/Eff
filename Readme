In this repository you will find code to compute Eff by combining cDTI and DENSE datasets.

The function interp_DTI_DENSE_KM take in entry a folder directory which should include your cDTI and DENSE datasets processed as follow:

- A folder named 'DENSE' which containt a .mat file for each of processed DENSE slices using the DENSEAnalysistool framework (https://github.com/denseanalysis/denseanalysis)
 I will soon include other source of displacements and format such as .DNS or .txt files

- A folder named 'DTI' which containt .mat file of your cDTI slice processed using the DiffusionRecon framework (https://github.com/KMoulin/DiffusionRecon)
This framework works only for Siemens cDTI for now since DENSE is only available for Siemens for now. I will soon include other vendors.

The result will be saved in a .mat format in created 'Result' folder.
